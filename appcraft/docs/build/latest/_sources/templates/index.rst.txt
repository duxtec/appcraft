Templates
=================
In AppCraft, templates define the foundation of a **layered architecture**, ensuring modularity and independence. Each template provides a specific set of features that seamlessly integrate into a project.

All templates are **modular and independent**, allowing them to be combined as needed, making project construction **flexible and scalable**. Whether you require **logging, localization, web interfaces, or API handling**, you can mix and match templates without compromising the core structure of your application.

By leveraging AppCraft's template-based system, developers can streamline development while maintaining a **clean and maintainable architecture**.

.. rubric:: Base Template

The **Base Template** is the foundational template of the framework, providing the backbone for the project's architecture in layers. It serves as the starting point for any application using the framework, offering a solid foundation and essential functionalities for efficient project management.

The Base Template includes the following features:

- **Simplified Management and Execution of EntryPoints**: The Base Template facilitates the setup and execution of various entry points in your project, allowing you to define and organize the core functions of your application.

- **Automatic Management and Installation of Missing Dependencies**: The template automatically handles the installation of dependencies, ensuring that your project has everything it needs to run correctly without requiring manual setup.

- **Error Handler**: It includes a robust error handling mechanism, allowing you to capture and manage exceptions appropriately, ensuring the stability and integrity of the system.

- **CLI UI Theme**: The Base Template includes a user interface theme for the CLI, providing a visually organized and consistent way to interact with the system, improving the user experience.

- **Customizable Message Printer**: The template offers a system for printing custom messages, allowing you to display different types of messages (such as success, warning, error, critical, title, and info) in a clear and formatted way, making communication with users easier during execution.

With these features, the Base Template establishes a solid and easy-to-use foundation for building and expanding projects, keeping them organized while offering great control over dependencies and user interaction.

.. rubric:: Logs

The **Logs Template** provides a structured logging system that enhances error tracking and debugging capabilities. It includes **log rotation**, configurable **logging levels**, and multiple output formats to ensure all application logs are properly stored and organized.  

This template features a **customized Logger** that automatically saves logs in **time-organized files**, making it easier to locate specific entries. In **debug mode**, it leverages the libs **structlog, better-exceptions, and rich** to improve log readability in the terminal.  

Seamlessly integrated into the **Core** of the framework, the logging system operates **automatically**, requiring no additional imports or manual configuration, ensuring a smooth developer experience.

For more information about this template, you can check the dedicated page: `Logs Template Documentation <logs/index.html>`_.

.. rubric:: Locales

The **Locales Template** provides a **built-in internationalization (i18n) system** for managing multilingual support in applications. It automatically handles **language detection, message translation, and formatted output**, ensuring seamless adaptation to different locales.  

At its core, the **MessageManager** class manages **gettext-based translations**, loading the preferred language dynamically based on system settings or user configuration. It supports **.po and .mo files**, automatically compiling translation files when necessary.  

This template also enhances **CLI interactions** by intercepting the standard print function, ensuring that messages are automatically translated before being displayed. Integrated directly into the frameworkâ€™s **Core**, the **Locales Template** requires no additional setup, providing a modular and efficient solution for multilingual applications.

.. rubric:: Flask UI

The **Flask UI Template** provides an integrated **FlaskApp** that can function independently or in combination with the **Flask API** and **SQLAlchemy** templates if installed. It ensures a seamless integration within a **layered architecture**, maintaining modularity and flexibility in web application development.  

This template introduces a well-structured **presentation layer** for UI endpoints under `presentation/web/ui`, offering built-in support and examples for constructing **Web UIs** efficiently.. It automatically sets up a **Flask application**, configures **routing** for **dynamic views, static views, and assets** and includes **error handling** for missing routes.  

Additionally, if the **SQLAlchemy Template** is installed, the **Flask UI Template** will attempt to initialize the database connection, providing built-in support for ORM-based persistence. Otherwise, it gracefully operates without database integration, ensuring versatility in different application setups.

For more information about this template, you can check the dedicated page: `Flask UI Template Documentation <flask_ui/index.html>`_.

.. rubric:: Flask API

The **Flask API Template** provides an integrated **FlaskApp** that can function independently or in combination with the **Flask API** and **SQLAlchemy** templates if installed. It ensures a seamless integration within a **layered architecture**, maintaining modularity and flexibility in web application development.

This template introduces a well-structured **presentation layer** for API endpoints under `presentation/web/api/v1`, offering built-in support and examples for constructing **RESTful APIs** efficiently.. It automatically sets up a **Flask application**, configures **routing** for **APIs** and includes **error handling** for missing routes.  

This template is designed to manage **APIs**, offering built-in support and examples for constructing **RESTful APIs** efficiently. It automatically sets up a **Flask application**, configures **routing** and includes **error handling** for missing routes. 

This template includes essential **API dependencies**, such as:

- **flask-login** (user authentication)  

- **flask-restful** (simplified API routing)  

- **flask-cors** (cross-origin resource sharing)  

- **flask-compress** (response compression)  

Additionally, if the **SQLAlchemy Template** is installed, the **Flask API Template** will attempt to initialize the database connection, providing built-in support for ORM-based persistence. Otherwise, it gracefully operates without database integration, ensuring versatility in different application setups.

.. rubric:: Web Scrapping

The **Web Scraping Template** provides a structured environment for efficiently extracting data from websites. It includes **pre-configured scripts** and essential libraries for handling web requests, parsing HTML, and automating interactions with web pages.  

- **Key Features**

   - **Multiple Web Scraping Adapters:** The template includes an **adapter for each scraping library**, allowing flexibility in choosing the best approach for different use cases.  

   - **Standardized Architecture:** It provides an **abstract base class** for web scraping adapters, ensuring a **consistent and reusable** structure across different implementations.  

   - **Service Demonstrations:** It includes examples of **data extraction and storage services**, showcasing best practices for handling scraped data.  

- **Included Dependencies**  

   This template integrates powerful web scraping tools, such as:  

   - **browser_manager** (headless browser management)  

   - **scrapy** (high-level web scraping framework)  

   - **selenium** (browser automation)  

   - **requests & requests-html** (HTTP requests and dynamic content rendering)  

   - **beautifulsoup4, lxml, pyquery** (HTML/XML parsing)  

   - **fake-useragent** (randomized user agents for avoiding detection)
