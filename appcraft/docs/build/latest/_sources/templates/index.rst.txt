Templates
=================
In AppCraft, templates define the foundation of a **layered architecture**, ensuring modularity and independence. Each template provides a specific set of features that seamlessly integrate into a project.

All templates are **modular and independent**, allowing them to be combined as needed, making project construction **flexible and scalable**. Whether you require **logging, localization, web interfaces, or API handling**, you can mix and match templates without compromising the core structure of your application.

By leveraging AppCraft's template-based system, developers can streamline development while maintaining a **clean and maintainable architecture**.
