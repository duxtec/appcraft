Logs Template
=============================
The **Logs Template** provides a structured logging system that enhances error tracking and debugging capabilities. It includes **log rotation**, configurable **logging levels**, and multiple output formats to ensure all application logs are properly stored and organized.  

This template features a **customized Logger** that automatically saves logs in **time-organized files**, making it easier to locate specific entries. In **debug mode**, it leverages the libs **structlog, better-exceptions, and rich** to improve log readability in the terminal.  

Seamlessly integrated into the **Core** of the framework, the logging system operates **automatically**, requiring no additional imports or manual configuration, ensuring a smooth developer experience.
