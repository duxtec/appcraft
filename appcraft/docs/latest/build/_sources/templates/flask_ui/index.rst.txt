Flask UI Template
=============================
The **Flask UI Template** provides an integrated **FlaskApp** that can function independently or in combination with the **Flask API** and **SQLAlchemy** templates if installed. It ensures a seamless integration within a **layered architecture**, maintaining modularity and flexibility in web application development.  

This template introduces a well-structured **presentation layer** for UI endpoints under `presentation/web/ui`, offering built-in support and examples for constructing **Web UIs** efficiently.. It automatically sets up a **Flask application**, configures **routing** for **dynamic views, static views, and assets** and includes **error handling** for missing routes.  

Additionally, if the **SQLAlchemy Template** is installed, the **Flask UI Template** will attempt to initialize the database connection, providing built-in support for ORM-based persistence. Otherwise, it gracefully operates without database integration, ensuring versatility in different application setups.
