Locales Template
====================

The **Locales Template** provides a comprehensive **internationalization (i18n) system**, enabling seamless multilingual support within applications. It ensures that messages, commands, and outputs are dynamically translated based on the user's locale, improving accessibility and usability across different languages.  
The **Locales Template** is fully integrated into the frameworkâ€™s **Core**, requiring no additional setup. It leverages a built-in translation system to dynamically load locale-specific resources and ensures smooth adaptation to multiple languages.  

Key Features:
--------------------

- **Dynamic Language Detection:**  
  The template automatically detects the system's preferred language or allows users to specify their preferred locale for translations.  

- **Message Translation with Gettext Support:**  
  It leverages the **gettext** system for managing translations, supporting **.po and .mo files**, ensuring efficiency in message handling.  

- **Automatic Compilation of Translation Files:**  
  The template detects uncompiled translation files and **automatically compiles them**, ensuring that translations are always up to date.  

- **CLI Message Translation:**  
  The **Locales Template** intercepts standard print operations, ensuring that messages displayed in the command-line interface are automatically translated before being printed.  

- **Seamless Framework Integration:**  
  Designed to work natively within the framework, the template requires no external dependencies and follows a modular structure for efficient multilingual support.  


Benefits:
----------------

- **Effortless Internationalization:**  
  Automatically manages translations without requiring manual intervention, providing a smooth multilingual experience.  

- **Consistent User Experience:**  
  Ensures that users receive messages in their preferred language, improving accessibility and usability.  

- **Automated Translation Handling:**  
  Automatically compiles missing translation files, keeping them updated without additional configuration.  

- **Integrated CLI Localization:**  
  Command-line outputs are localized dynamically, reducing the need for hardcoded translations in scripts.  

The **Locales Template** offers a fully integrated, scalable, and automated approach to internationalization, ensuring that applications can adapt efficiently to multiple languages without additional complexity.
