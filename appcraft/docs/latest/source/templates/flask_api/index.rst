Flask API Template
=============================
The **Flask API Template** provides an integrated **FlaskApp** that can function independently or in combination with the **Flask API** and **SQLAlchemy** templates if installed. It ensures a seamless integration within a **layered architecture**, maintaining modularity and flexibility in web application development.

This template introduces a well-structured **presentation layer** for API endpoints under `presentation/web/api/v1`, offering built-in support and examples for constructing **RESTful APIs** efficiently.. It automatically sets up a **Flask application**, configures **routing** for **APIs** and includes **error handling** for missing routes.  

This template is designed to manage **APIs**, offering built-in support and examples for constructing **RESTful APIs** efficiently. It automatically sets up a **Flask application**, configures **routing** and includes **error handling** for missing routes. 

This template includes essential **API dependencies**, such as:

- **flask-login** (user authentication)  

- **flask-restful** (simplified API routing)  

- **flask-cors** (cross-origin resource sharing)  

- **flask-compress** (response compression)  

Additionally, if the **SQLAlchemy Template** is installed, the **Flask API Template** will attempt to initialize the database connection, providing built-in support for ORM-based persistence. Otherwise, it gracefully operates without database integration, ensuring versatility in different application setups.
