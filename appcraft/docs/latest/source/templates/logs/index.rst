Logs Template
=============================

The **Logs Template** provides a structured and efficient logging system, enhancing error tracking, debugging, and application monitoring. It ensures logs are properly stored, rotated, and formatted to maintain clear visibility of system events.  

The **Logs Template** is seamlessly integrated into the frameworkâ€™s **Core**, operating automatically without requiring additional setup or manual imports. It ensures all logging functionality is readily available across the application.  

Key Features
-----------------

- **Structured Logging System:**  
  Implements a well-organized logging mechanism that categorizes logs by severity levels, ensuring clarity in debugging and monitoring.  

- **Log Rotation for Efficient Storage Management:**  
  Automatically rotates log files based on time intervals or file size limits, preventing excessive log growth and improving performance.  

- **Configurable Logging Levels:**  
  Supports various logging levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`), allowing fine-grained control over log verbosity and filtering.  

- **Multiple Output Formats:**  
  Provides structured log formats, including plain text and JSON, making it adaptable for both human-readable logs and machine-parsed analytics.  

- **Enhanced Debug Mode:**  
  In development mode, integrates **structlog, better-exceptions, and rich** to provide visually improved, color-coded, and more readable terminal logs.  

Benefits
----------------

- **Improved Error Tracking & Debugging:**  
  Enables faster identification of issues by structuring logs in a clear and organized format.  

- **Optimized Log Storage Management:**  
  Automatic log rotation prevents excessive disk usage and keeps logs well-organized over time.  

- **Seamless Framework Integration:**  
  Operates directly within the framework, eliminating the need for additional configurations or external logging setups.  

- **Developer-Friendly Debugging:**  
  Provides enhanced, visually formatted logs in debug mode, making it easier to trace and understand errors.  

The **Logs Template** delivers a powerful, automated logging solution that enhances application monitoring and debugging while ensuring logs remain structured, scalable, and easy to manage.
